orginally developed by researchers at Texas A&M University and USDA Agricultural Research Service and here customized by Environmental Defense Fund with updated in-stream pesticide/toxic chemical fate and transport processes. 

The Soil & Water Assessment Tool is a small watershed to river basin-scale model used to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and ground water and predict the environmental impact of land use, land management practices, and climate change. SWAT is widely used in assessing soil erosion prevention and control, non-point source pollution control and regional management in watersheds.

This version of SWAT2012 is a fork of SWAT2012 rev. 681 released on 2020 Jun 8.
